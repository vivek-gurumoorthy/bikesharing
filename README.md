# Bikesharing with Citibike

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize a variety of metrics concerning the use of the Citibike bikesharing system and in turn inform the strategy of a new venture to implement a new bikesharing system in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
### Trip Duration

This demonstrates the typical duration of most recorded bikerides. Clearly, almost all of the bikerides are less than 1 hour in duration. Most rides are less than 20 minutes length as shown by the drastic peak that occurs before the 20 minute trip duration mark.

From this visual, it does not appear that any gender rides the Citibikes for a clearly longer or shorter time. All three lines, male, female, and unknown gender, exhibit a peak similar to that of the peak indicated by the combined graph mentioned previously. Male users seem to make up the largest proportion of all rides, however, when compared to female users and those of unknown gender. 

### Trips by Day of Week and Hour
<img width="1012" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 46 18 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196966042-77bd8679-89ce-460f-80ec-29d085f12f64.png">
Generally, it appears most Citibike usage occurs in the early morning or late afternoon on weekdays, while on weekends it can be spread more evenly throughout the day.




| Male Riders  | Female Riders | Riders of Unknown Gender |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|<img width="491" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 49 34 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196966915-ce44b320-1aa7-4362-aafa-24c68763e2dc.png">| <img width="506" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 47 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196966413-81f4407d-4387-4d6f-a100-962a2a894467.png">| <img width="511" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 50 34 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196967200-cf962bbd-9a28-49fd-83b3-c1374b8a1ae1.png">

This heatmap overall shows similar results as the previous heatmap when it comes to male and female customers, as evidenced by peaks in early morning and late afternoon. During the weekend, it appears that the Citibike records a disproportionate number of riders of unknown gender, perhaps due to influx of riders who are just temporarily visiting the city over that weekend.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
<img width="1001" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 54 14 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196968166-00e1f4cb-2f5c-49c7-a2b1-62302a3dca57.png">
Clearly, there are many more rides recorded by subscribers than by non-subscribers. And, given the fact that male riders comprise the majority of trips, male subscribers are the most common users of citybikes followed by female subscribers.

### Top Starting and Finishing Locations
| Top Starting Locations  | Top Finishing Locations|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img width="1005" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 55 21 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196968482-a000b057-dc21-4514-a71e-13236e88c85d.png"> | <img width="821" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 55 55 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196968634-b7e65857-e7c3-49ee-be06-6d7dd35a42b4.png">

This demonstrates where riders typically most commonly start and end their rides. In this visual it is clear that the most commmon starting places and the most common finishing places are generally in the same area. This area could perhaps be a space of more dense population. Knowing the most common location where riders typically start and end may enable Citibike to devote more of its resources to these particular areas for bike maintenance.

### Bike Utilization
<img width="988" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 9 57 46 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108832056/196969061-4038cfe6-1ab3-4133-a702-0749f9c29681.png">
This visual demonstrates which bikes have had the most use over their time. Use is measured in both number of rides given as well as amount of time spent by users riding that particular bike. This visual would be very useful for identifying the bikes that are needed for repair/maintenance due to wear and tear. These bikes would be the dots on the graph that are larger and more red in color.

## Summary
Overall, some takeaways from the NYC Citibike data would be that rides typically last 5-15 minutes, male riders are the most common users of citybikes, usage peaks in the early morning and late afternoon on weekdays and is spread throughout the day on weekends, and that the common locations of the starting and ending points of rides occur in the same general area.

Two additional ideas visuals that could be useful:
* Differentiating usage over years by looking at the other years of citibike data and joining into one larger dataset
* Pulling NYC weather data for 2019 and visualizing whether recorded inclement weather is associated with drops in citibike usage
